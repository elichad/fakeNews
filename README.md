# fakeNews

Created for BrumHack 7.0, 18-19th November 2017. A Twitter bot (no longer running) that you can tweet a news article at, and it will tweet back with a 'fakeness' rating for the article. Uses a multinomial naive Bayes classifier to study article text, with training data from https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/fake_or_real_news.csv (primarily US politics articles).
